## Challanges and their suitable solutions :->

# Descriptive Statistics
(1) for Numerical Columns we check for stats such as Max, Min, Mean, count, standard deviation, 25 percentile, 50 percentile, and 75 percentile.
(2) for Categorical Columns we check for stats such as count, frequency, top, and unique elements.

# Treatment of Missing Values
use Mean, when we do not have Outliers in the dataset for the Numerical Variables.
use Median, when we have outliers in the dataset for the Numerical Variables.
use Mode, When we have Categorical Variables.

# outlier detection
An outlier is an object that deviates significantly from the rest of the objects. They can be caused by measurement or execution error.
The presence of outliers in a classification or regression dataset can result in a poor fit and lower predictive modeling performance. 
Instead, automatic outlier detection methods can be used in the modeling pipeline and compared, just like other data preparation transforms that may be applied to the dataset.

# statistical and quantitative analysis :
(1) Univariate analysis is simplest form of statistical analysis method.The key fact is that only one variable is involved
(2) Bivariate analysis is one of the simplest forms of quantitative analysis. 
    It involves the analysis of two variables, for the purpose of determining the empirical relationship between them. Bivariate analysis can be helpful in testing simple hypotheses of association.
(3) Multivariate analysis is based on the principles of multivariate statistics, which involves observation and analysis of more than one statistical outcome variable at a time


# feature engineering :Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data via data mining techniques

# Dealing with Categorical Columns : 
  There are various ways to encode categorical columns into Numerical columns
  This is an Essential Step, as we Machine Learning Models only works with Numerical Values.
  Here, we are going to use Business Logic to encode the education column
  Then we will use the Label Encoder, to Department and Gender Columns

# Splitting the DataÂ¶
This is one of the most Important step to perform Machine Learning Prediction on a Dataset, We have to separate the Target and Independent Columns.
store the Target Variable in y, and then  store the rest of the columns in x, by deleting the target column from the data
Also, changing the name of test dataset to x_test for ease of understanding.

# Resampling
Resampling is the method that consists of drawing repeated samples from the original data samples. The method of Resampling is a nonparametric method of statistical inference

# Feature Scaling
Feature scaling is a method used to normalize the range of independent variables or features of data

# ML model :
Decision Tree Classifier
A decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility. 
It is one way to display an algorithm that only contains conditional control statements.

# A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model (or "classifier") on a set of test data for which the true values are known.
